        <p>Drawing inspiration from seeing the Yahoo.Com homepage, a web portal was
        created with programmers in mind. Users are led to a programmer relevant homepage
        that displays tech news, allows users to leave themselves notes, check the weather, 
        watch youtube videos, access the most used reference pages, and place an emphasis on 
        mental health with sections dedicated to making the user happy despite the crazy world
        around them.
        </p>

Utilizing one of the Bulma CSS Frameworks features of Modal Cards, the projects section was divided up into
tiles that displayed screenshots and a modal button that included Demo gif's as well as links to the respective 
project GitHub repositories and Deployed application links for reference.
